## [Selections from John James Audubon's _Birds of America_ at the Lilly Library](https://ericayhayes.github.io/audubon)

Welcome to the repository for Selections from John James Audubon's _Birds of America_ at the [Lilly Library](http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/). Curated by [Professor Christoph Irmscher](https://english.indiana.edu/about/faculty/irmscher-christoph.html) at Indiana University, Bloomington, this online exhibit features 50 plates from the Lilly Library's first edition of Audubon's double elephant folio, _Birds of America_ and excerpts from his writings, _Ornithological Biography_.  

Originally a [touchscreen display](http://eyhayes.com/audubon/) featured at the Lilly Library, this digital exhibit has been updated to include IIIF images and annotations. This digital exhibit was built using [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/#/wax/?id=top), an extensible workflow for producing scholarly exhibitions with minimal computing principles. Wax relies on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [IIIF](http://iiif.io/) level 0 compliance static files, [Leaflet IIIF](https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/), [IIIF_S3](https://github.com/cmoa/iiif_s3), and is built upon the work developed by [Marii Nyr√∂p](http://marii.info/), [Peter Brinkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex). This exhibit also includes IIIF annotations using [Niqui O'Neil's](https://dnoneill.github.io/) [annona range storyboard](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/annona/).
